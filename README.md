### Tests
I only wrote a few integration tests, no unit or end-to-end.

`yarn test`

### Take Aways
I did not finish the "edit user details after signup", as I ran out of time. Sorry.

If I was to do this challenge again I would do it differently regarding the Apollo client. I realized I took a wrong turn and it was too late in the game to fix it due to time constraints.

 I've always been taught/told to go through your own server first and then make external calls. I failed to see that the random GraphQL api in this challenge was representative of the Leonardo api, and you were more curious of how I would integrate things. I struggled mentally with allowing images from an external service be displayed, and even had to override the safety settings in NextJS, but pushed through the discomfort to display them for the spirit of this challenge.
 
 I ended up adding a ton of backend stuff, and blew past the 2 hour recommended time limit.
