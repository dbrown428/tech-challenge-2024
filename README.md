If you could please complete the following steps:

1. Please document your code appropriately.
2. Set up a NextJS project with TypeScript.
3. Ensure your project is set up with git.
4. Use the ChakraUI component library for UI elements.

5. Have a welcome modal with two separate slides:
a. On the first modal slide, have the user set a username.

At Leonardo.Ai we prefer to have as few dependencies as possible. Please follow this guideline during your test.
We will be evaluating you on your ability to take initiative and think about the user experience, accessibility, and the product quality as a whole. We will be grading you as if this were a product you are publishing to production.
For public GraphQL APIs, you could look here - https://github.com/IvanGoncharov/graphql-apis - there are demo APIs at the bottom of the page.
Please ensure we can access your project and relevant code for grading.
Let us know if you have any questions! Good Luck
